# Hello! ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kiko

and I am a passionate about **photography** ðŸ“·, a passion that has been with me for many years, but especially since I bought my first digital SLR camera in 2016, when I began to introduce myself to **landscape** photography.

Some of the things that I enjoy the most about this hobby are the shared **experiences**, the **unique** moments that I try to reflect in my photographs and, probably the most, the connection that I live with **nature** as I got closer to it to represent those moments.

I value each and every one of the steps of my **creative process** through which photography moves me, from planning the photos to editing my work.

## Another of my passions

it's (for many years also) the **design** ðŸŽ¨. Actually I started in it in 2003, shortly after leaving the university degree in Fine Arts (in Altea, in the faculty belonging to the Miguel HernÃ¡ndez University of Elche). And it was in my Higher Graphic Design Studies, in Alicante, where I had my first contact with design of **digital interfaces** (web). From that moment to date, it's where I have been forging my current profession.

## Currently

I work as a **software engineer** ðŸ’» in the _Web Platform_ team of Adevinta Spain, giving support to the developers working in the different marketplaces of the company (such as [Coches.net](https://www.coches.net), [Fotocasa](https://www.fotocasa.es/es) or [InfoJobs](https://www.infojobs.net)), prioritizing the quality, stability and optimization of their web applications.
